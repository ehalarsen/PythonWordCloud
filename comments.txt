Talent Management Feedback
Feedback From O-4 Population
What Keeps you in
Family stability (location, spouse able to work)
Newness and challenge of the MOS
Ability to meaningfully contribute to the nation (a fair process to get to this point)
Ability to contribute (compared to perceived responsibility and scope of jobs in civ world)
Community and comradery
What’s Driving you out
Lack of family stability, frequent moves and moves to locations spouses either cannot find jobs, are delayed/set back in doing so
Lack of a say in assignments / location
Lack of transparency in how critical billets are chosen
Lack of process transparency (how 1702s are treated on boards, how they are selected for school/command)
Unclear / unpublished career path, ESP external to the MOS (makes staying in a perceived risk)
Impact if we change policy
Won’t likely impact decision to stay past 20 years, will impact quality of time up to 20
Not a huge impact, would like Command.  Also likes idea of applying for open billets (like Army can do)
This would make a large difference, esp in regards to billets suited for qualifications
What aren’t we talking about
Staying at MFCC does not mean 1702s are not well rounded
Board precept that is clear about career path, and about how 1702s are supposed to be specialists, not generalists
NPS process.  Completely timing based, whole picture rarely considered.  Needs a complete overhaul.  HUGE missed opportunity
17s need an opportunity to participate in Enterprise IT at some point in their career.
Deployment opportunities 
Feedback From O-3 Population
What Keeps you in
Educational opportunities
Technical opportunities
Ability to homestead (relative to move of the Marine Corps)
Being a Marine, being part of the 1702 community
What’s Driving you out
Inconsistent organizational responses (ex COVID)
Unnecessary rules and regulations
Opportunity in the civilian world 
Increased pay in civilian world (not a significant driver, but a thing)
Impact if we change policy
Slightly better overall satisfaction, not a major difference
Very positive
What aren’t we talking about
Worried about enlisted talent retention
Codify 1702s as a TECHNICAL MOS, provide a somewhat standardized process to make it to a team
Career progression clearly communicated both inside and outside the community (mentoring, FITREPs, boards)
Reasons I continue to serve:
I continue to serve because I have a desire lead marines in real cyberspace missions that have an impact on society. The people I work with are smart, professional, and team players. The culture of Marines that I have encountered in this occupational field have an attitude of professionalism and ingenuity that extends beyond the end of the workday.  They enjoy cerebral work and spend their free time honing their keyboard skills in order to make a bigger personal impact.

Additionally, I take pride in the impact and effect that my contributions provide to the world at large. This is not a feeling I have maintained over the course of my career thus far, rather it is a new driving factor I have only experienced as a member of this National Mission Team. This team is separate and distinct from my previous Marine Corps experiences, as the team’s efforts and executions provide a real impact. Because of this, I have almost never left at the end of the day feeling as though my time has been wasted. 

This skill field allows Marines to consistently receive meaningful training that has a direct impact on their current mission. Continuing to serve means that I can develop myself in a way that makes me more applicable in this field if/when I choose to leave the service. However, the civilian world can never equal the excitement of working with my NSA/CYBERCOM counterparts to solve the hard problems facing the nation.

I continue to serve primarily due to the cooperative work environment that many, but not the majority, of Marine Corps units and teams provide. I derive enjoyment in my profession by working with a set of like-minded individuals that maintain the ability to plan and execute in a direct, aggressive, and devoted fashion toward a common goal – all while eschewing many of the traditional “corporate” considerations that can delay or destroy a team’s effort. Essentially, Marines provide an environment where everyone can swallow their personal pride and feelings for the sake of the mission – reserving time to resolve those issues when the operational tempo can permit it. This is directly contrasted with my experiences in “traditional” units, as the continual onslaught of scripted exercises, lack of effective training, unrealistic requirements, and the regular failure of administration can effectively destroy one’s sense of self-worth and idea of intrinsic value. This is especially true of first-term Marines (officer and enlisted alike), having just committed 4-8 years of their life to a false sense of importance levied by recruiting propaganda.

While different from perhaps the FMF, the culture of Marines here remains relentless and dedicated. People have an attitude of professionalism and ingenuity, and a sense of humor, and enjoy challenge.

I still have a desire to serve my country in some capacity. Being at Fort Meade also helps as I appreciate the overall environment the NSA side of Fort Meade cultivates, the mission sets, and the knowledge that we’re on the “front line” of the current fight in cyberspace.

Fulfilment of a unique job, that would be difficult to find elsewhere
Ability to continue to work with a small subset of highly intelligent, skilled, and motivated individuals

Reasons I would consider Resignation / Retirement:
The organization as it stands now, appears to be burdened with an ever-increasing lack of fundamental trust at almost every level of leadership. Senior leaders continue to increase the level of micromanagement expected at each subsequent level within their scope – rather than consenting to a level of trust within their responsible echelons of command and staff. 

This sentiment is the direct result of senior leaders (i.e. company command and above) that refuse to, or are unable to, maintain their technical proficiency – thus they are unable to communicate, assess, or understand the real level of risk within a plan. This refusal and inability is caused by the organization’s refusal to effectively evaluate an individual’s technical prowess in concert with their leadership and communication abilities, and opting to continually promote those which have minimal understanding of the plans and operations for which they are responsible for – leading to metrics, reports, and assessments that are essentially meaningless and irrelevant, but end up being the foundation upon which my value to the organization is evaluated and understood. 

The personal sacrifices I make, in my off-duty time, to become a technical expert are not valued organizationally. I believe that this sentiment is the direct result of senior leaders that refuse to, or are unable to, maintain their technical proficiency – thus they are unable to communicate, assess, or understand the real level of risk within a plan. This refusal and inability is caused by the organization’s refusal to effectively evaluate an individual’s technical prowess in concert with their leadership and communication abilities. Opting instead to continually promote those possessing a minimal understanding of the plans and operations for which they are responsible. This leads to metrics, reports, and assessments that are essentially meaningless and irrelevant, but still end up being the foundation upon which my value to the organization is evaluated and understood. Lack of technically proficient leadership also leads to questionable organizational employment structures. For instance: “bringing cyber to the fleet” by sending our most senior Captains to FMF billets. A technical leader would understand that this is a nonsensical employment of capabilities that actually robs the service of efficacy. That Officer will NEVER employ the technical skills they learned here in the FMF. The Marines that serve in this filed want to serve in the most technical roles. If you arbitrarily remove them from those roles you will lose them.

The need to continuously promote and obtain billets so you can “get command someday” is by far the most obscene requirement to levy upon the service. We’re not all going to be commanders, it’s not possible. By forcing us all down the path of command, you essentially create a hostile employment environment where your highly skilled Marines (with no desire to command) simply prepare themselves to take their skills to a financially lucrative job.  

The Marine Corps clearly grasps the concept of paying more for special skills. It’s also quite clear that concept only extends to things that fly. Our sister services have created pay incentives (both Officer and Enlisted) for their skilled cyber operators. It’s professionally embarrassing that there’s no promulgated plan to do this for the Marine Corps.

If a Marine puts forth a wealth of effort and continuously makes a measurable impact, at great personal cost to themselves, their return on equity is being arbitrarily assigned to a geo-location of zero interest to them to perform a role that has zero impact both personally and professionally. This continuously leads our most technical Marines feeling deposed and undervalued, ultimately leading to the path of least resistance in the civilian job market.

For example: originally, Marines assigned to this unit were done so with the understanding that the tour of duty would encompass 4 years, as opposed to the traditional 3 year tour. This was a smart decision, as the training, requirements, and level of experience necessary to be effective would likely require an entire year – resulting in two to three years of effective employment. Now, an officer will execute a billet for 12-18 months before being rotated to another position within the command. This restricts an individual’s effective employment in a highly technical environment from 3 years in one position to less than 6 months in each position. This movement decision is also conducted behind closed doors, and never involves the Marine. Though a seemingly bespoke example, it’s actually quite representational of the manning landscape within the Marine Corps. All the major elements are there: lack of personal control, no regard to personal technical ability, no recourse for poor placement, etc. Marines don’t want to be treated as though they’re just a warm body to fill a billet on a spreadsheet.

Failure to attain reasonable work/life balance. From my observation, our team has an important mission and a drive and purpose that makes long hours, nights, and weekends worth it. I am thankful to be part of a unit that works hard towards a meaningful end. In all of my assignments so far, though, the climate and tendency towards work have caused burnout and neglect of my personal life, goals, friends, family, etc. Many jobs on the outside have clearer boundaries and more flexibility on total working hours and scheduling, and people are often compensated for overtime – these factor into my calculus of staying in vs. getting out. I can imagine many potential future billets I may hold, such as on the staff or in the DCO-IDM, that would not have the same level of purpose or meaning to justify the demanding schedule from a personal perspective.

Lack of personal freedom to travel. I enjoy travelling, domestically and abroad, and have found that the implementation of liberty boundaries, as well as requirements for international travel, are a limit on my personal freedom. I understand these are policies that prevent primarily junior Marines from making bad judgment calls, but they are unnecessary for SNCOs and officers, and waste both work and off-hours in the case of most international travel paperwork.

Requirement to PCS. As outlined in the Talent Management document, arbitrarily forcing PCS is often unnecessary, expensive, and can decrease cohesion. With specific regard to the cyber occupational field, it can also be catastrophic to readiness, where workrole training occupies well over half of one’s time on station and directly inhibits the individual’s ability to contribute to the team, and the team from accomplishing the mission.

The strict ladder, “up or out”, and key billet rotation that forces officers to move through many different billets in a short amount of time to meet the required wickets at each grade.  The strict format and constant movement encourages mediocrity among the officer corps where officers are expected to know just enough to get by in any specific field.  

The Marine Corps struggles to find its’ place in cyberspace.  This has caused issues with the employment or lack of employment of teams OPCON to MFCC.  The current solution of adding a MCCOB in the chain of command does not solve the problem and potentially will exacerbate it as the battalion is not prepared to develop operational planning expertise to employ the teams that are OPCON to it.

The desire to “Bring Cyber to the Fleet” and attach Cyber Units to Ground Elements without any ability for those units to serve a technical mission vice allowing Operational Units to continue to accomplish the National Mission from Ft. Meade.
What resonated to me about the USMC talent management efforts?

I appreciated that they recognized that there was a problem with retention and were willing to take unique steps to address them. The few things that stood out were the recognition of how detrimental a PCS cycle could be to a unit, alternate career paths for officers who wanted to stay on a certain track, and the option of a lateral move for those outside of the military or those who left to come back into certain positions if they applied for it. I think that incorporating a talent marketplace for assignments where officers would apply for positions and conduct interviews is a big step in the right direction. To that end, providing Marines the Latitude to exit the service and return as a lateral entry would allow for the recruitment of top talent. Leaving the service shouldn’t be a bridge you can never re-cross.

It was refreshing to read that there is finally a desire, from the highest ranks, to change long standing policies that have outlived their utility. The efforts to modernize unit-level recruitment and the assessment of individually targeted talents is by far the largest value to this current draft. In the civilian world, I can be employed by one organization, and if my interests or desires change over time, I can focus efforts toward the goal of a new position at another organization that meets my desires. This is not a current reality in the organization – as my placement is decided and often changed without any respect to what value I would provide and whether that value is maximized for the organization.

It's interesting they had a focus on “improving physical fitness”. We need a focus on teaching Marines how to PT and recover correctly at an early age. This could help retention, both from injury prevention and physical health stand point. The Marine Corps should have certified civilian trainers, fitness instructors, and nutritional specialists, similar to what the Air Force does. Tailored physical fitness and nutrition plans would go a long way toward improving the quality of the Marine Corps.

Maturity of the force: The biological concerns concerning younger Marines aside is potentially a leadership problem. That being said, it would be interesting to see the effect on the service if the minimum age was raised to 21 and the minimum pay were doubled. The recruitment pool would be radically different. 

A focused process for Marines to review their leadership is a nice change of pace. The 360-Degree Evaluations seem like a great idea to screen out toxic leadership. Gaining a more holistic picture with more metrics and inputs for leaders could only help the Marine Corps.

Career flexibility and “One-Time promotion Opt-Out” in allowing officers to stay at lower ranks for a longer period of time and can have the ability to still promote in the future will potentially retain individuals who don’t desire the “command track” as it’s currently written.  However, making the Opt-Out permanent will cause officers who specialize to hit a glass ceiling that doesn’t exist in the commercial or federal employment sectors. The “Opt Out” feature should also come with a method for that Marine to earn a higher pay band while retaining their technical role.

Not requiring PCS as a function of time, by policy (wasteful and inhibits cohesion)
Stabilizing personnel for longer to enhance cohesion
Latitude to exit service but potentially return as a lateral entry
Incorporating talent marketplace for assignments
One-time promotion opt-out
Unnecessary emphasis on command

The talent marketplace shows promise but like any system its’ value will be dependent on employment.  Concerns would be nepotism in desirable locations or units in that the commanders who have local officers will most likely choose known goods over unknown potential candidates.  This could cause a regional divide in more talented officers being centralized where more talented commanders and young officers stay while less desirable locations or units end up with the bottom of the talent spectrum across the entire officer corps.

Who determines/ what criteria determines highly qualified civilians to enter as mid-career officers? Allowing Marines that EAS’d to come back in at a higher rank after spending time out in the civilian sector. Who would determine the appropriate rank upon their return? 

A.I. programs to aid Monitors seems like it would be very helpful. In my mind, I still envision Monitors having a name on a board and having to hot fill certain billets, which leaves out many factors from the PCSing Marine’s prospective in regards to their desires and career goals

What is missing from these efforts?
-How to appropriately pay a “more mature” force
-How to appropriately pay critical skills to compete with industry (AIP lacking)
-A Plan to accommodate the slow DODCAF clearance process (intel / cyber specific)
-How are people paid during their parental leave?
-What does recruiting for an MOS like cyber look like? How much do 17’s need to know before they get into the MOS?
-Will highly skilled civilians who transition to mid-level officers still have the same command opportunities as those who promote through the ranks within their MOS?
-Who determines/ what criteria determines the highly qualified civilians to enter as mid-career officers? 
-Regarding the notion of allowing Marines that EAS’d to come back in at a higher rank after a break in service sector: who would determine the appropriate rank upon their return? 


Paraphrasing form the document, the phrase “…that while our Marines will always be important, the mission will also take priority over individual needs.” To counter that thinking: how will the mission succeed if the force is understaffed, undertrained, and not-motivated to go the extra mile? It is often the action of one person that makes the difference between success or failure. The mission may be more important, but without Marines, there is no mission.

Enabling the movement of unrestricted officers to limited duty officers or vice versa.  Currently unrestricted officers who desire to become technical experts cannot move to become an LDO or WO. Enabling the flexibility to transfer between the two communities would be a powerful retention tool.

These efforts include several mentions of being “data driven”, “AI enhance”, and other superlative tech-business terms, there is minimal mention of the organization providing a mechanism to understand the individual. To quote Robin Dreeke (former Marine Officer and FBI Counter Intelligence agent), what is missing is a direct method of addressing an individual’s “priorities, needs, wants, dreams, aspirations [in the] personal, professional, long-term, short-term” and that these aspects are being functionally addressed in the total picture of managing talent.

Enabling the movement of unrestricted officers over to limited duty officers or vice versa.  Currently unrestricted officers who desire to become technical experts cannot move to become an LDO or WO. I am not aware of the reverse path being an option but LDOs can make it up to LtCol.  Enabling the flexibility to submit to transfer between the two communities in technical MOSs will retain officers who desire a career compatible with the other side.

The ability to implement this model in a time realistic format
