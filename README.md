# PythonWordCloud
This is the code for a wordcloud using python
The links for the different word cloud shapes and colors are in the source code, commented out.  Use them to chose the shape and colors you want!


The following PIP modules WILL need to be installed prior to running the script

stop_words
stylecloud

Be aware that style cloud works best with an older version of matplotlib, you can fix this by running the command pip install matplotlib==3.2.2 or another older version once you have verified that it works.
